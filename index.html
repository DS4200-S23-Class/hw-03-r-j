                                <li>It is a good mapping because colors are very differentiable, and viewer can tell from this visualization immediately which candidate would have been elected by women in each state</li>

                                <li>This is a good mapping because it shows which states vote for Clinton/Trump and how larger the size corresponding to that color hue indicates that more people vote for that candidate.</li>

                                <li>This is a good mapping because the color choice are roughly the same saturation and value, but perceptually distant. Viewer can easily distinguish from visualization that woman prefer to vote for Clinton rather than Trump in 2016</li>
